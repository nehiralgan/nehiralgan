## 👋 Hi, I'm Nehir

I am an **Information Technology** student with a strong focus on **Python programming** and **Data Science**.

My academic and project work centers on applying data-driven and machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly in computer vision, biometric analysis, and pattern recognition.

I have experience developing systems that combine classical data processing methods with deep learning models, including similarity learning with Siamese neural networks and feature-based analysis. My projects emphasize not only performance, but also interpretability and robustness of model decisions.

Currently, I am interested in **data analysis, machine learning, visual feature extraction,** and **trustworthy AI systems**, especially in scenarios involving limited datasets and explainable model behavior.
